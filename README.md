# Real-time-Single-Multiple-Facemask-Detection-Using-YOLOv3-and-OpenCV-

After the breakout of the worldwide pandemic COVID-19, there arises a severe need of protection mechanisms, face mask being the primary one. The basic aim of the project is to detect the presence of a face mask on human faces on live streaming video as well as on images.

The Final Product after training a model using YOLOv3. Contains different code to work with images and videos. Real-time detection can be achieved by modifying the code for video to read inputs from respective webcam.

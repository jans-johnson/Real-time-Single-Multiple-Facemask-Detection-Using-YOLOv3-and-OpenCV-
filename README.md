# Real-time-Single-Multiple-Facemask-Detection-Using-YOLOv3-and-OpenCV-

In the present scenario due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. Also, the absence of large datasets of ‘with_mask’ images has made this task more cumbersome and challenging.

The Final Product after training a model using YOLOv3. Contains different code to work with images and videos. Real-time detection can be achieved by modifying the code for video to read inputs from respective webcam.
